# Task 1 (ContentSharer):
I explored Firestore Database and Firebase storage but to upload images on Firebase Storage, it's required to upgrade the project's billing plan. So just uploaded some images on the imageBB and used it's urls to store in the Firestore Database Documents. Which i'm loading dynamically along with the titles to display the tiles. 

# Task 2 (MVVMAppDemo):
As i mentioned above that i was not able to use the Firebase Storage as it requires to upgrade the project's billing plan, so I was not able to complete the Task 2 which requires file submission on the Firebase server.

# Task 3:
Use below credentials (email - password) to login and list and create notes:

testuser@example.com - testpassword \
hardip@example.com - harrdip \
tester@gmail.com - testerpass
